QOS BootSector description
--------------------------

Version 1.0
24-04-2004


Changes since last version:
 - None



Overview
--------------------------

The bootsector is the first sector that should be executed at boot
time. It should be able to run on almost every computer, therefor
be written in strictly 16bit assembler code. The main goal is to
load the kernel from the disk into the memory.


Current Features
--------------------------

Currently there is a partial support for the QOS FileSystem, which
enables that the kernel can be build as if it were a normal file.
However, the kernel must have some specific properties. The kernel
must be located in the Root directory of the disk, under the name
'QCore' and the attribute byte set to 0xFF.


Boot sequence
--------------------------

   1. The stack is installed at 0x9000:0x0000.
   2. The Root directory is loaded and stored.
   3. Root directory is searched for QCore with attributes 0xFF.
   4. The kernel is loaded into memory at 0x0060:0x0000.
   5. Segments are reset and the kernel is executed.
