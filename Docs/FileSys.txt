QOS FileSystem description
--------------------------

Version 1.0
24-04-2004


Changes since last version:
 - None



Overview
--------------------------

The filesystem is pretty basic, with a number of limitations. The most
important limitation is the number of directories and files, which is
28 directories, including root directory, without subdirectories, and
25 files in every directory. This also means there should be no more
space filled with file index tables than 26 sectors.

However concerning the files, there are more flexible properties.
Every file has a 12 byte filename, can be placed anywhere within 65535
sectors and span a maximum of 255 sectors.

The directory tables are basicly the same with a 12 byte name, and
with the reference to the file table somewhere within 65535 sectors.



VDIR Drive Table
--------------------------

Every disk formatted with the QOS Filesystem has a VDIR Table, which
is always located at the second sector of the disk. For every
directory there's a record the name and address of the matching file
table.

   Total of Directories:    1 B
   Undefined:               3 B
   Volume Name:             11B

   Repeat up to 27 times (18 Bytes)
      Directory Name:       12B
      Filetable Sector:     2 B
      Extra Options:        4 B



VDIR File Table
--------------------------

For every directory there should be a Filetable which contains the
references to the files within the directory. Every file reference has
a information about the filename, attributes, position and length.
Each FileTable is refered to in the VDIR Table, except for the Root
directory FileTable which is always placed in the third sector without
referral.

   Total of Files:          1 B
   Undefined:               11B

   Repeat up to 25 times (20 Bytes)
      File Name:            12B
      Attributes:           1 B
      File Sector:          2 B
      Sector Span:          1 B
      Offset:               2 B
      Size:                 2 B
